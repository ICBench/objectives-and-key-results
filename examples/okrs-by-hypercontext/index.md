## General 


### Personal Development


#### Be more effective with time management

Organize and manage your time in order to get the most out of every moment, avoid disorganization, and ensure that you stay on top of things.

    Use the Pomodoro technique every day for the next 4 weeks
    Take 15 minutes at the end of each day to review what you've accomplished


#### Improve resilience

Resilience is the muscle that helps us cope in challenging situations. It helps us find opportunity in adversity, keep going after a failure, navigate change, and perhaps most importantly, it gives us the courage to take risks and try new things.

    Spend 10 minutes per day exercising mindfulness (E.g. Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer)
    Meet with a coach every 2 weeks to focus on resiliency
    Lead a self-guided retrospective once a week to explore areas where you were resilient and areas that could have been improved (E.g. Areas of fragility, weakness, rigidity)

    Participate in {#} strategic courses this year
    Read 2 business books (I.e. Traction and The Lean Startup)

    Read the book "Creating a Culture of Feedback"
    Ask for feedback from your manager or a team member at least once per week
    Use Feeling-Behaviour-Impact (FBI) or Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) models to give constructive feedback at least once per day

    Grab a coffee with someone currently working in a role you want in 5 years

    Ergonomic chair
    If possible: a private and quiet room
    Strong WiFi connection
    Coffee maker
    Plants, art, or other things to inspire and/or relax you


#### Keep the team connected

One of the biggest challenges remote workers face is experiencing feelings of loneliness. Let's make sure that we're doing everything we can to build a culture at work that keeps everyone connected beyond just work conversations.

    Launch coffee dates app in our communication channel (I.e. Donut in Slack)
    Create 3 new channels in our communication app to connect people with similar hobbies (#pets, #travel, #wine-and-cheese-club)
    Run {#} events, local and face-to-face, for colleagues in your area this quarter

#### Run remote-first meetings

With the rise of remote work, managers need to approach meetings with a remote-first mindset in order to be inclusive, productive, and keep the lines of communication open for everyone on the team.

    Decide on tech stack for meetings (I.e. Hypercontext + Google Hangouts)
    Ensure all meetings are scheduled with all participants in mind by accommodating to different time zones
    Use a shared agenda to give all participants time to review, contribute, and prepare for the meeting beforehand

### Team Building and Culture

### Managers


#### Practice agile leadership

Agile management values are based on the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. This approach to leadership is something that should be applied to leaders across all departments.

    Put people over process (E.g. Write 3 handwritten cards to team members to celebrate milestones)
    Put action over analysis (E.g. Reduce build-measure-learn cycle by 2 weeks)
    Put performance over presence (E.g. Ensure every team member has documented OKRs and check in meetings scheduled)
    Put listening over speaking (E.g. 50% of agenda items in hypercontext.com are from direct reports)
    Put will over skill (E.g. Run a monthly coaching session with your team)


#### Ensure leaders are successful

Do our leaders have the knowledge and support they need to effectively manage their teams? Focus on fostering a culture of great leadership by leading by example.

    100% retention of seasoned leaders

#### Build and lead a best-in-class team

    Ask every direct report "Who's recently done great work" at least once during one-on-ones this quarter
    Celebrate every win publicly (I.e. Slack Channel, All Hands, etc)


#### Implement a new one-on-one program

One-on-ones are a great opportunity to build trust, share feedback, and engage with each team member. They provide a dedicated time and place to discuss everything from roadblocks to career aspirations, let’s make them count. Do this across the team to foster better communications between managers and their direct reports.

    Choose a one-on-one meeting platform.
    Pick 1-3 themes for the next 6 months for the team to improve (I.e. growth, communication, motivation)
    Meet with all people managers to introduce the concept and discuss the themes
    Introduce the concept to your entire team and ensure meetings are set up for each manager and their direct reports

### Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI)

#### Operate as an anti-racist leader

As a leader with broad amounts of power and privilege, you need to do more than just not be a racist. You need to use your privilege to integrate anti-racism and allyship into the practices and processes of the engineering team you lead, as well as the organization's leadership team. Let's focus on removing systematic racism from our company and from society as much as our span of control will allow.

    Run every proposed keyword through our SEO tool before approving a first draft
    Conduct a competitive analysis before creating outlines for writers
    Check on-page SEO for every piece (headers, keywords, secondary keywords, meta text, etc.)


#### Ensure base-level content guidelines are met – then go above and beyond

Managing Editor might not be synonymous with “perfectionist,” but it should be! Your goal is to ensure content is as engaging, clear, and unique as possible.

    Use the target keyword in the title and the main header, but don’t stuff the content with it for every published piece
    Do thorough edits for grammatical and spelling issues, structural issues, on-page SEO issues, and design issues for every published piece
    Always choose images that align with the content and reflect its intent
    Run all content through a plagiarism-checking software to ensure originality

#### Coach your support agents daily

Choosing the right KPIs helps your team narrow their focus, but you can’t improve customer outcomes without the right guidance and coaching.

But remember, coaching and feedback should be organic—you don’t need a formal 1:1 or meeting to notice and reinforce the right behaviors.

    Schedule recurring one-on-one meetings with all of your direct reports
    Fill out 5 agent scorecards every month
    Leave detailed and actionable feedback on 5 agent interactions

    Conduct a monthly analysis of the number of repeat callers to see what sparks repeat calls and work internally to fix top 3 issues
